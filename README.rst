Silly mpv scripts
=================

mpv_ is fantastic, but it could be ever so marginally betterâ€¦ this is an attempt
to make it so.  You'll find here various totally quick and dirty scripts that
enhance my ``mpv`` experience, perhaps they'll do some thing for you too!

The scripts are released under the GPL v2 or later, to follow the example set in
the upstream project.

Included scripts
----------------

.. note::
   See the scripts for further information, including usage.
