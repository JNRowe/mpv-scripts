Silly mpv scripts
=================

mpv_ is fantastic, but it could be ever so marginally betterâ€¦ this is an attempt
to make it so.  You'll find here various totally quick and dirty scripts that
enhance my ``mpv`` experience, perhaps they'll do some thing for you too!

The scripts are released under the GPL v2 or later, to follow the example set in
the upstream project.

Included scripts
----------------

.. note::
   See the scripts for further information, including usage.

clock
'''''

*No, really*.  Having a popup clock is super useful, it saves having to dip in
and out of fullscreen mode all the time.

It is bound ``backtick`` by default, simply because that matches my ``Mod4``
binding in awesomewm_ to toggle the wibox.

rating
''''''

A super simplistic rating system for files.  Hit ``<C-{1..5}>`` to toggle
a symlink in ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/mpv/ratings``.  Then you can play files with
a specific rating by ``glob``'ing at the symlink directories.

Bugs
----

If you find any problems, bugs or just have a question about this package either
file an issue_ or drop me a mail_.

If you've found a bug please attempt to include a minimal testcase so I can
reproduce the problem, or even better a patch!
